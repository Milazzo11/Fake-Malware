A program to prank someone into thinking he/she has a computer virus (C++).

The program will run once, and the computer will shut down.  It will use the data.txt file
to store data to "remember" that it has been executed once.

To resuse the program, simply clear the data.txt file (this is an important failsafe, so it is
best not to remove it)

NOTE: Be responsible and enjoy :)
